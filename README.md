# CSCE633_ML_Intro
Introduction to Machine Learning

I include my codes to all algorithms covered:

0.  Reading MNIST data: **This has to be run at the beginning**

1.  Principal Component Analysis

2.  Linear Discriminant Analysis

3.  Softmax Classifier

4.  Support Vector Machine - Soft Margin case  : **Still working on it**

5.  Kernel Ridge Regression:  **Still working on it**

6. Conditional GAN for image-to-image translation:
